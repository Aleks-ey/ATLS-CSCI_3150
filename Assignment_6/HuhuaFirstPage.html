        <p>
        Welcome to my first webpage. While you are here, let me tell you about 
        <strong><a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.com/agecheck?redirect_uri=%2Fgames%2Felden-ring">Elden Ring</a></strong>.
        Elden Ring is the newest game in a series of <strong>"souls-like"</strong> games created by FromSoftware.
        It is an action role-playing game centered around a distinct style of gameplay that
        challenges the player. In my opinion, Elden Ring is the <strong>greatest</strong> game ever made. The story
        for Elden Ring was even written in collaboration with George R. R. Martin, the creator
        of Game of Thrones.
